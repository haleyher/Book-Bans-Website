  <h2>What's the Issue?</h2>
  
      <p>Banned and challenged books are not something new. The censorship of books have been around for a long time. In 1639, the first book ever banned because it went against the public's beliefs. This is a trend with Censorships of books, as those in authority want to shape our ideology. </p>
       <p>Many schools across America are banning books for being too graphic, sexual, possessing crude language, LGBTQ+ content and more. Those in authority, or in some cases the students' parents, want to shape their ideology. I personally believe that these students should be given the chance to read the books and then make the decisions for themselves. I understand in some cases, though. It would be not the best to have a very explicit book in an elementary school. However, the people that need the representation in media or even ones who want to learn the stories from marginalized groups are suffering. </p>

      <h2>The Importance of the Stories</h2>
      
       <p>In some cases, It's not even just marginalized groups. It's the stories that should be spread, but are still being censored. Last year, I read <i>Maus</i>, which is a comic book depicting a story from the Holocaust but with a twist. It represents all of the characters as animals, with Jewish people becoming mice and then the Nazis becoming cats. The book is about a very serious subject matter and treats it well. I personally believe it was a good story to learn about in school to further explore that time period.</p>

      <p>Currently, more than 1,000 books have been banned in schools. It's starting to turn into what books like <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>1984</i> wanted to warn us against.</p>
